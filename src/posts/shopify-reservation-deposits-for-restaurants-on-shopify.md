Reservation deposits are one of the most effective ways to reduce no-shows and protect revenue — especially during peak times and for larger parties. With BiteMe In, you can enable deposits conditionally, so you only require a deposit when it makes sense for your restaurant and your guests.

This guide explains why deposits work, how conditional rules operate, and the best way to configure your policies for a smooth, guest-friendly experience.

## Why Reservation Deposits?

- Reduce no-shows and last-minute cancellations
- Protect high-demand time slots and special dates
- Improve table availability accuracy for real guests
- Encourage commitment for larger parties and peak times

## How Conditional Deposits Work

You can define deposit rules that apply only when certain conditions are met:

- Party Size: e.g., require a deposit for parties of 5+ guests
- Day of Week: e.g., deposits on Fridays and Saturdays only
- Booking Time: e.g., deposits for dinner service (6pm–9pm)

These rules can be combined, allowing you to require deposits only for larger parties during peak dining hours or specific days — keeping the experience frictionless for smaller weekday bookings.

> Example Policy: “A reservation deposit of $20 is required for parties of 6+ on Friday and Saturday evenings.”

## Step-by-Step Setup in BiteMe In

1. Open BiteMe In in your Shopify admin
2. Go to Settings → Policies & Deposits
3. Enable deposits
4. Configure rules:
   - Select party size threshold (e.g., 5+)
   - Choose applicable days of week
   - Set the time window (e.g., 17:00–22:00)
   - Define the deposit amount (fixed or per guest)
5. Save and publish your policy
6. Optional: Add a brief note on your booking page confirming deposit rules

## Policy & Messaging Best Practices

- Keep policies clear and concise on your booking page
- Mention when deposits apply (party size, day, time)
- Explain how deposits are handled (applied to bill, refundable with notice, etc.)
- Offer a grace period for changes or cancellations when feasible
- Train staff to communicate deposit rules consistently

## Guest Experience Tips

- Use friendly language (e.g., “To ensure availability for larger parties…”) 
- Provide alternatives (waitlist or earlier/later times) when deposits apply
- Offer automatic deposit application to final bill where appropriate
- Send email confirmations including deposit details

## Frequently Asked Questions
