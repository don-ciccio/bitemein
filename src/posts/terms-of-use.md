---

## 9. Limitation of Liability

### 9.1 Exclusion of Damages

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall BiteMe In, its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, suppliers, or licensors be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, consequential, or punitive damages whatsoever, including but not limited to:

- Loss of profits, revenue, or business opportunities
- Loss of data or information
- Loss of goodwill or reputation
- Business interruption
- Cost of substitute goods or services
- Failure to realize expected savings
- Loss arising from customer disputes, cancellations, or no-shows
- Damages arising from third-party claims by your customers
- Personal injury or property damage

This limitation applies regardless of the legal theory on which the claim is based (whether in contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or otherwise) and whether or not BiteMe In has been advised of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy specified in these Terms is found to have failed of its essential purpose.

### 9.2 Liability Cap

IN ANY CASE, BITEME IN'S ENTIRE AGGREGATE LIABILITY under any provision of these Terms or in connection with your use of or inability to use the App SHALL BE LIMITED TO the amount actually paid by you for the App through the Shopify App Store during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim, or ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (US$100.00) if no purchase has been made, whichever is greater.

This cap on damages is the single most important financial risk mitigation strategy and is fundamental to the financial viability and long-term sustainability of BiteMe In. It allows the business to operate with predictable risk exposure.

### 9.3 Essential Purpose

You and BiteMe In understand and agree that the disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations in Section 8 and this Section 9 are essential elements of these Terms and represent a reasonable allocation of risk between the parties.

You acknowledge and agree that BiteMe In would be unable to make the App available to you on an economically feasible basis except on these terms, and you agree that these Terms will survive and apply even if any limited remedy specified herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.

### 9.4 Jurisdictional Limitations

Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages. In such jurisdictions, the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you, and BiteMe In's liability will be limited to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.

## 10. Indemnification

### 10.1 Merchant Indemnification Obligation

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless BiteMe In and its affiliates, officers, directors, agents, employees, partners, and licensors (collectively, the "BiteMe In Parties") from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, expenses, and fees (including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs) arising out of or in any way connected with:
