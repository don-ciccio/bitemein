## The Digital Revolution

The restaurant industry is experiencing a digital transformation that's changing how businesses operate and interact with customers. From online ordering to AI-powered analytics, technology is becoming essential for success.

## Key Technologies Reshaping Restaurants

### 1. Online Ordering Systems

Digital ordering platforms have become crucial:

- Mobile apps for easy ordering
- Website integration
- Third-party delivery partnerships
- Contactless payment options

### 2. Kitchen Display Systems

Modern kitchens are going paperless:

```typescript
interface Order {
  id: string;
  items: OrderItem[];
  status: 'pending' | 'preparing' | 'ready' | 'delivered';
  timestamp: Date;
  estimatedTime: number;
}

class KitchenDisplay {
  private orders: Order[] = [];
  
  addOrder(order: Order): void {
    this.orders.push(order);
    this.updateDisplay();
  }
  
  updateOrderStatus(orderId: string, status: Order['status']): void {
    const order = this.orders.find(o => o.id === orderId);
    if (order) {
      order.status = status;
      this.updateDisplay();
    }
  }
  
  private updateDisplay(): void {
    // Update kitchen display with current orders
    console.log('Kitchen display updated');
  }
}
```

### 3. Data Analytics

Restaurants are leveraging data for better decisions:

- Sales trend analysis
